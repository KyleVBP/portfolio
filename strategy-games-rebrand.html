  section-txt="For the primary sketches of this project I looked to create something that would show off the fact that Strategy Games is a game store. Chess pieces were a common theme in these sketches but I didn't want to entirely give the same logo they previously had but with an updated look. So while a chess piece makes a lot of sense I didn't try to focus too hard on it, and included other things that would resemble strategy, or board games."
