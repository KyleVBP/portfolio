  section-txt="For the primary sketches of this project I looked to create something that would show off the fact that Strategy Games is a game store. Chess pieces were a common theme in these sketches but I didn't want to entirely give the same logo they previously had but with an updated look. So while a chess piece makes a lot of sense I didn't try to focus too hard on it, and included other things that would resemble strategy, or board games."

  section-title="Second Sketches"
  section-txt="After going through all my initial sketches I picked 2 ideas I liked best and went onto making variations of those 2. Even though I wasn't too interested in using a chess piece I did think it is a good idea while staying true to their original design. This idea is also open to a lot of variation and interpretation. So I decided to continue with some of those chess pieces from round 1 and refine them in this stage. The other idea from my first sketches that I enjoyed was incorperating a flag. The idea behind the flag came from my research were I found it was a common theme between some board games, as well as the strategy genre overall. So I continued with a few of those to be refined."
