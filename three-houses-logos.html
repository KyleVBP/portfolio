  section-txt="This project was for fun, I designed logos based on each of the Houses from the new game in the Fire Emblem series, Fire Emblem Three Houses. This is a Tactical RPG on the Nintendo Switch. I wanted each to be slightly refined and simplified versions of what is shown in the game, pictured below."
