  colors:
    background: "--color-background"
    accent: "--color-primary"
    text: "--color-text"
  rationales:
    typefaces.primary: |
      Roboto was selected because it is appealing as a sans-serif font and pairs well with the secondary font.
    typefaces.secondary: |
      Nunito Sans was used for the headers to help contrast with Roboto.
    colors.primary: |
      The green is used for headers, marked text, and the logo, the darker version is used in some areas to assist the hierarchy.
    colors.secondary: |
      The grey is used in the bulk of the site for text and blocked in areas to contrast the primary green and background grey.
