When working on a motion project theres always something I envision for the final product and I always feel that with hard work I will reach a certain point on projects where I get to the point I envisioned.

Kyle Pereira is a Graphic Designer interested in Typography, Motion Graphics, and Web Development. I came to Algonquin's Graphic Design program out of high school where I had a big interest in photography, designing, and video editing.
