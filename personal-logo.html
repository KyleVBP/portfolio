  section-title="The Idea"
  section-txt="My starting point for this project was that I wanted to have a motion piece I would be able to use for myself for the future. So I felt animating a personal logo for myself would work best, and it could be used for a motion reel, as well as other projects in the future. Having this put at the start of my motion pieces and my site leaves people with something to remember who I am, especially if theyâ€™ve seen multiple of my works. With this I though it would be best to further expand on this brand by working on some social media elements by making headers, and making a wordmark from what would have originally just been a simple logo."
