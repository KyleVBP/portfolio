  section-title="The Idea"
  section-txt="My starting point for this project was that I wanted to have a motion piece I would be able to use for myself for the future. So I felt animating a personal logo for myself would work best, and it could be used for a motion reel, as well as other projects in the future. Having this put at the start of my motion pieces and my site leaves people with something to remember who I am, especially if they’ve seen multiple of my works. With this I though it would be best to further expand on this brand by working on some social media elements by making headers, and making a wordmark from what would have originally just been a simple logo."

  section-txt="My first sketches were just some simple storyboards I did to get my ideas out on paper. This first concept didn’t really go anywhere but I do think it helped set me on the right track. I had a slight idea of what I wanted my logo to look like so I was trying to make an animation based on that. For the logo I wanted it to take the arm and leg from the K and the bowl from the P of my initials and simplify them. The elements from both those letters when pressed together form a square, but only with the P simplified into 2 lines rather than a circle. With my idea for the logo in my mind I decided it would be best to iron it out rather than continue to work on my animation."
